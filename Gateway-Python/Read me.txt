The Vinduino gateway example code for the Globalsat LD20H USB dongle is written in Python3.

Python modules needed for the Vinduino gateway script:
- serial
- time
- thingspeak (linux install: $ sudo pip3 install thingspeak)
- sqlite3

DB browser for SQLite (http://sqlitebrowser.org) is a great program to manage the SQLite database.
Linux install: $ sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser


For Windows, install the Cypress USB serial driver

For Linux: 
Linux does not require a special drivers for the USB serial interface, however ensure that you have qt4, gcc, and libusb installed.  The USB driver stack in Linux has a built-in driver for CDC-ACM class devices. The Cypress chip inside the LD-20 supports CDC-ACM class, CDC-ACM driver gets automatically bound to the device and creates a device node in /dev/ttyACM*(* -The name of device node will vary based on the number of devices connected).

Here is a good description for testing the USB serial connection in Linux:

I found that Ubuntu and RPI recognized the USB serial port, but likely assumed it was an AT-command modem. 

A solution that worked for me is to bypass the ModemManager: 

sudo systemctl mask ModemManager.service
