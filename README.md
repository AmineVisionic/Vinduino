# Vinduino
The Vinduino project started from the necessity to manage irrigation in my small Southern California vineyard, by monitoring soil moisture at different depths and at several vineyard locations. 
Soil moisture monitoring systems have been around for decades, but they cost hundreds to thousands of dollars and -because these systems are proprietary- there will be ongoing cost to customize and maintain these systems. As a small vineyard owner, I needed something low cost and flexible.
The open source Arduino platform, together with low cost gypsum soil moisture sensors, provides all that. While I first envisioned the Vinduino project (Vineyard + Arduino) for my personal interest and needs, but now the scope has broadened to providing easy to use, open source, low cost solutions for agricultural irrigation management.

Saving water is more important now than ever. The drought that is ongoing  in California for four years, made everybody realize the importance of reducing water use. But it is not just California that is plagued by prolonged drought periods. Large agricultural areas in South America, India, China, and Africa suffer from continuing water shortage as well.

To date, the Vinduino project provided the following results, published on the Vinduino blog and github:

- How to make and calibrate low cost gypsum soil moisture sensors
- Handheld soil moisture reader (Arduino gypsum sensor interface circuit + open software)
- Irrigation valve control with Arduino and motor driver board
- Digital water pressure meter (open software)
- Water pressure data logger (open software)

In development/prototype:

- Vinduino-H, handheld reader (prototype stage)
- Vinduino-R, Remote multiple sensor reading station + Internet connectivity (prototype stage)
- Sensor galvanic voltage effects compensation (software test stage)
- Comparison industry standard Watermark sensor with DIY gypsum sensor
